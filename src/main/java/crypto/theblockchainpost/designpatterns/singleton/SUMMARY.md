# Singleton Pattern

---

### Chapter 5

The singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and
provides a global entry point to it.

There are several ways of creating a Singleton, the book takes you from
the easiest (without checks for creating multiple instances with
threads) to the most efficient: the implementation as an enum.

I will just code examples in the package.
