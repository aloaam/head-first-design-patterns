# Observer Pattern

---

### Chapter 2

The observer pattern is used when there is "centralized entity" to which
other are dependent to. 

The centralized entity is called the **subject**, and the dependents one are called
the **observers**.

A common analogy to understand this pattern is the relationships between a publisher and
its subscribers. Where the former is the subject and the latter are the observers.

**Design principle**:
> Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.


### Real Life Examples
In Java, JavaBeans and Swing libraries used the observer pattern.


This section explains the observer pattern creating it from scratch using a weather-data
application. Then it creates a Swing class showing how this patter is implemented there.
This implementation is stored under the package example.
